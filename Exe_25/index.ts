// Exercise 25
//  Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
//  • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
//  • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)  

 

 //program 1


 let alien_color = "green";

 if( alien_color == "green") { console.log("version 1");
    
        console.log("congratulation! you have  earned 5 points");

 };


 //program 2   (no output of this program)


  alien_color = "blue";

 if( alien_color == "green") { console.log("version 1");
    
        console.log("congratulation! you have  earned 5 points");

 };
